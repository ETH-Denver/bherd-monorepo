# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Compile the contracts:
```shell
npx hardhat --network <network-name> run scripts/deploy.js
```
Deploy deployer contract to network:
```shell
npx hardhat --network <network-name> run scripts/deploy.js
```

The script will log a deployer address under the key `target` which you will add to the relevant .env variable in the frontend .env file
